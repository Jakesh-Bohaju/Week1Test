B. Expected Output
    { "market@qq.com" : {"Occurance":2, "EmailType": "Non-Human"} ,
    "jeff.peterson@b2bsearch.com" : {"Occurance":1, "EmailType": "Human"}
    }
C. Explanation:
    The output must be in a nested json format.
    "Occurance" : No of times the email is repeated in the text.
    "EmailType" : Type of the email. You can have more complex logic to identify human and non-
    human emails but in this exercise, Just try the logic given below:
    Finding human emails: If the email is of format firstname.lastname@email.com then you can
    assume that the email is human.
    Finding non-human emails: If the email format is text@email.com where text is less than 8
    characters, then you can assume that the email is likely to be non-human.

Note: During extraction of email I found 'REALTORSÂ®;realtors@bbn.com' from the txt file. 
So, it is treated as email beacause email accept special character also. 
I have set new 'EmailType' as Null if such mail arise i.e neither 'Human' nor 'Non-Human'
as per the description mention.
